# Transpic

An application to help you our when traveling.

## Motivation

Often, when trying to purchase something in Japan, I had issues pronouncing the word, eventually displaying a picture of the item I was looking for on my phone. This usually would solve the issue. But to get there I had to go through a few steps:

- translate the word from English to Japanese and copy the kanji
- open Safari, paste the kanji and search for images
- display the picture to the employee

All done while the employee is impatiently waiting trying to understand what the hell I'm trying to do.

Searching directly for the English word would not make the trick since items in Japan are different and named differently, so you'd probably display a picture of something he's never seen before.

This application aims to solve this by allowing you to input a word in a language and search related images of the word translated in a target language.
